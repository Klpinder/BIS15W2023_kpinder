> **Want to Make it as a Biologist? Better Learn to Code**  
> "In biology, big data is the thing. Every day, biologists go into the lab to coax data out of living matter—more and more data, with the advent of biological tools like Crispr/Cas9..."We cannot manually look through 15,000 data points anymore," Udeshi says. To analyze it all, biologists need to write programs specifically tailored for their experiments."

## Course Summary  
In BIS 015L, you will be introduced to the fundamentals of data science with emphasis on data frequently used by biologists. We will use the R software environment to develop and practice key skills including data management, transformation, analysis, and visualization. Examples will span a range of disciplines including social science, ecology, evolution, and genetics. Labs will use a problem-solving approach where we build on previously learned skills culminating in a small, group-based project. 

This class is designed for students with *no background in computer programming, R, or statistics*. Our assumption is that you know how to turn a computer on and use a mouse- that's it!  

## Equipment  
In order to complete the homework and exams, you need to be able to run R and RStudio. Mac and PC computers both work, but *not* Chromebooks. If you experience problems, contact [Joel Ledford](mailto:jmledford@ucdavis.edu).  

## Health and Safety  
We take the health and safety of everyone in the class very seriously. If you are not feeling well, please do not come to class. Your grade will not be penalized for missing class.  

## UC Davis’ Principles of Community  
We expect all interactions in this class to be guided by the [UCD Principles of Community](https://diversity.ucdavis.edu/principles-community). This stresses commitment to a climate of equity, inclusiveness and justice that is demonstrated by respecting and celebrating one another. The richness of our learning community and our ability to address pressing societal challenges require all of our unique contributions and perspectives. In this class, we will value open expression of our individualism, within the bounds of courtesy and respect to others. We will confront and reject all manifestations of discrimination, including based on age, citizenship status, disability, ethnicity, gender, gender expression, nationality, race, sexual orientation, socio-economic class, status inside or outside the university, veteran status, religious/non-religious, spiritual or political beliefs, or any other differences among people which have been excuses for misunderstanding, dissension or hatred.  

Please communicate with the instructional team:  

* If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official records.  
* If you feel like your performance in class is being significantly impacted by your experiences outside of class. We can work with you to provide additional support and advice, connect you with campus resources, or modify deadlines if warranted by the circumstances.  
* If something is said in class (by anyone) that makes you feel uncomfortable, please talk to us about it, or provide anonymous feedback.  

## Educational Equity  
UC Davis is committed to educational equity in the academic setting, and in serving a diverse student body. We encourage all students who are interested in learning more about the Student Disability Center (SDC) to contact them directly at [SDC](mailto:sdc.ucdavis.edu) or 530-752-3184. If you are a student who receives academic accommodation(s), please submit your SDC Letter of Accommodation to us as soon as possible, ideally within the first week of this course.  

## UC Davis Land Acknowledgement  
UC Davis has a formal land acknowledgement to recognize the Indigenous people who have lived where UC Davis is today. It was written by the Yocha Dehe Wintun Nation and approved by the three Patwin tribes who inhabit(ed) this land. The land acknowledgement is as follows: “We should take a moment to acknowledge the land on which we are gathered. For thousands of years, this land has been the home of Patwin people. Today, there are three federally recognized Patwin tribes: Cachil DeHe Band of Wintun Indians of the Colusa Indian Community, Kletsel Dehe Wintun Nation, and Yocha Dehe Wintun Nation. The Patwin people have remained committed to the stewardship of this land over many centuries. It has been cherished and protected, as elders have instructed the young through generations. We are honored and grateful to be here today on their traditional lands.”  

## Learning Goals  
*At the end of this course, you will be able to:*  
1. Use R and RStudio to perform basic analyses including arithmetic and basic statistics.  
2. Work with multiple types of data in R and RStudio including vectors, data frames, and nucleotide sequences.  
3. Import and transform complex, messy data for analysis in R using `dplyr`, `tidyr`, and `purrr`.  
4. Produce a variety of plots and charts to visualize results of data analysis using `ggplot2`.  
5. Build an exploratory analysis pipeline that can be applied to a variety of data types and structures.  
6. Use Shiny to build an interactive application.  
7. Use geospacial data to produce distribution maps.  

## Course Structure  
Our class has collaborative work as its foundation. Many people learn R on their own and there are literally thousands of courses designed to teach you the fundamentals. Working as a community is what sets our class apart. We encourage you to work together throughout the class!  

Our class is scheduled for 2-hour blocks on Tuesday and Thursday. Each class works though examples of live coding but includes frequent breaks where we will work together to solve problems. Please don't expect this to be a traditional lecture class- we require your active participation. After each class, there will be a homework assignment. We encourage you to work together on these! Since each assignment has many different solutions, the expectation is that your code is free from errors and runs cleanly. See grading below for details.  

There are two exams in the class, both of which are take-home. You may use any resources you like on the exam except for posting questions to open stacks or R programming forums; your work should be entirely your own.  

## Grading  
The class is graded out of 300 points on a straight scale. Grading is divided into four parts:  

1. **Weekly homework assignments (43%)**. Each assignment must be completed and uploaded to GitHub prior to the next lab. There are 15 homework assignments total and each assignment is worth 10 points. Homework is due at the start of each lab; no late work is accepted. To provide flexibility, we drop the 2 lowest homework assignments for the quarter so the maximum number of points is 130.  

2. **Midterms (23%)**. The midterms help us keep one another accountable. These exams will be take-home and the due dates are strict; no late work is accepted. Each midterm is worth 35 points.  

3. **Class project (33%)**. As part of the class, you will form a group to explore a project in data science. The project may be based on any available data of interest to the group and should highlight skills learned in the labs. The group will present their results during the last lab sessions.  The class project is worth 100 points.  

4. **Attendance**. As a skills-based lab class, attendance provides you with hands-on experience and help. If you know that you will not be able to attend in-person or you have significant planned absences this quarter, please reconsider enrollment. BIS 15L is not designed to be a remote class- there are already thousands of courses that teach R online. Our class has collaborative learning as its foundation and requires your attendance.  

If you miss class, please use the [class website](https://jmledford3115.github.io/datascibiol/) and [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFX-MipGKF9jCEXaP-59BzQ) as your guide. We will not be able to provide recordings of the labs, but these two resources will help you work through missed class material.  

## Suggested Reading  
[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/), Grolemund and Wickham (2017).  

## Office Hours  
Office hours are scheduled each week and are also available by appointment. If there are problems with the assignments, it is important that we communicate together as a class. Please use the class discord as a first step so we all benefit.
